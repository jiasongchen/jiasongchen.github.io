I am a Computer Science PhD student of University of Miami, fortunately supervised by Prof.[Liang Liang](https://liangbright.wordpress.com/). Our research focuses on developing novel machine learning algorithms and techniques that can be used to analyze medical images. 

My current research interests include **machine learning**, **adversarial robustness** and **biomedical image analysis**. I am motivated by the potential of deep learning to significantly improve healthcare by providing more accurate and efficient diagnoses, treatment planning, and disease monitoring.
